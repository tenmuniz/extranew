[Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: require() of ES Module /app/setup-environment.js not supported.

setup-environment.js is treated as an ES module file as it is a .js file whose nearest parent package.json contains "type": "module" which declares all .js files in that package scope as ES modules.

Instead either rename setup-environment.js to end in .cjs, change the requiring code to use dynamic import() which is available in all CommonJS modules, or change "type": "module" to "type": "commonjs" in /app/package.json to treat all .js files as CommonJS (using .mjs for all ES modules instead).
